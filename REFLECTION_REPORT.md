# Learning & Reflection Report

## AI Development Skills Applied

### Prompt Engineering
**Most Effective Techniques Used**:
1. **Specificity**: Providing exact requirements and constraints rather than vague descriptions
   - Example: Instead of "create a database", specified "PostgreSQL schema with Users, Customers, Contacts, SalesPipeline, and Tasks entities"
   - Impact: Generated production-ready database schema in one iteration

2. **Context Provision**: Explaining the purpose and background of each request
   - Example: "Create JWT authentication middleware for Express.js with TypeScript that verifies tokens, extracts user information, and includes role-based authorization"
   - Impact: AI understood the security requirements and generated comprehensive authentication system

3. **Iterative Refinement**: Starting with broad requirements and refining based on output
   - Process: Initial prompt → Review output → Refine with specific requirements → Final implementation
   - Impact: Achieved high-quality code with minimal iterations

## Key Learnings

### Most Valuable AI Technique
**Prompt Engineering with Specificity**
